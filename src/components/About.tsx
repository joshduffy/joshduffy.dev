          <p>
            I lead transformations—M&amp;A integrations, enterprise system implementations,
            organizational change management. The through-line: people navigating change.
          </p>
          <p>
            I run Change Managed, where I help companies through complex integrations
            and restructuring. I&apos;ve managed programs worth hundreds of millions,
            coordinated teams across acquisitions, and turned strategy into execution
            more times than I can count.
          </p>

            I build things too. Org structures, yes. But also project frameworks,
            technical tools, infrastructure. Currently tinkering with local AI—LLMs
            on Apple Silicon, agentic workflows, zero telemetry.
